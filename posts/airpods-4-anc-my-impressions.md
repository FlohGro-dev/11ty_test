-   I like the slightly smaller case
-   They feel very comfortable – can’t tell a real difference to the previous generations (but I never had issues with comfort)
-   I really enjoy the conversation awareness feature – it even pauses podcasts when you have a “longer” conversation – but not all people respond quick enough for this to trigger 😂
-   ANC is better than I thought but worse than I hoped 😝 but truly speaking it’s perfectly fine for what I need (I have AirPods Max for working at home with great ANC)
-   adaptive audio is weird – for now I prefer real ANC or full transparency
