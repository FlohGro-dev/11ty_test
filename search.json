You can e.g. define a workspace which filters for untaggged drafts in your library. The Action was published in this post in the forum: Process Drafts in INBOX Action [Configuration] Before running the action you have to adapt the name of your ‚Äûinbox‚Äú workspace. Therefore you need to change the following line in the script step of the action: let inboxWorkspaceName = &quot;INBOX&quot;; replace INBOX with the name of your inbox workspace (if you chose another one). Next you need to change the actions you maybe want to run on the drafts in your inbox. To do so, you have to edit the actionArray in the script. By default this array looks like this: let actionArray = [ ['skip', ''], ['‚úÖ Todoist inbox lines', 'INBOX line's'], ['üîó Todoist URL Task', 'Draft URL Task'], ['üóÇ Bookmark to DEVONthink', 'bookmark to DEVONthink'], ['‚å®Ô∏è Markdown to DEVONthink', 'Markdown to DEVONthink CB'], ['üè∑ add tags from category', 'add tag from category'], ['üóë trash', 'trash'] ]; Every element in the array (e.g. ‚Äû['üóë trash', 'trash‚Äò]‚Äú) contains two strings. the first string e.g. üóë trash defines how the action is displayed in the prompt. The second string e.g. trash contains the actual name of the action which shall be run. To insert your own actions you can choose a name ‚Äì how they should be displayed in the prompt and insert the action name in the second string. You can replace the existing ones by your own action or use the templates which are commented out ['', ''], by removing the slashes in front of them and insert your own name and the action name between the quotation marks.

When you duplicate the action for another space you have to change the name of the credential. Therefore you need edit this line const spaceIdCredentialName = &quot;CraftDocumentSpace&quot; in the script step of the action and change the CraftDocumentSpace to something different (e.g. describe the space in a suffix like ‚ÄûCraftDocumentSpacePersonal‚Äù or ‚ÄûCraftDocumentSpaceWork‚Äú.

There is no need to change something after installing the action since the template usage is disabled by default. If you want to use a template for the project document in Craft, create a new draft and give it a meaningful title (first line) and maybe add some tags to the draft to keep your library structured. Then setup the template in Markdown format (note that the title (first line) of the template draft will not be pushed to the Craft document) When you finished the template tap the ‚Äûinfo‚Äú button in the editor and then tap the button titled ‚ÄûUUID‚Äú. This will copy the UUID of that draft. Next, edit the script step of this action and change the variable in line 3 to true: const templateDraftAvailable = true;.

I want to share the Shortcuts I submitted to the contest with you. The first one ‚ÄúBE PRODUCTIVE BOTCUT‚Äù is of course productivity related and should help you doing and reflecting on focused working sessions. Additionally It suggests effective breaks you can make during your working day. The second shortcut ‚ÄùLinkCut‚Äù is an easy to use solution to store and retrieve often used (markdown) links. You‚Äôll find the descriptions and the download links below. Let me know if you find them useful. BE PRODUCTIVE BOTCUT BE PRODUCTIVE BOTCUT ‚Äì a shortcut to support you being productive and make effective breaks. This shortcut helps you to do (or to schedule) sessions of focused work, reflect on them, and make effective breaks in between or afterwards. I made this shortcut after reading and learning many things about Deep Working. I use it to kick off deep working sessions with no distractions for a limited time. After the session ends I quickly reflect if I achieved what I wanted and then make an effective break to help my brain to relax. This helps me a lot for the next focused work sessions and get the right things done in less time. Also typing the focus task and the reflections into the questions of the shortcuts sets me into the right mood of doing. When you run the shortcut you can either choose to start a focus session or directly get inspirations to make an effective break. If you choose to start a focus session the shortcut will ask you for the duration and the task you want to complete. The shortcut will run additionally configured shortcuts at the beginning (to e.g. set HomeKit scenes / start time tracking,‚Ä¶) and create a reminder for the end time of your focus session. At the end of your session the reminder will notify you ‚Äì when you open the reminder you can simply click on the link in the reminder (to run the BE PRODUCTIVE BOTCUT) which will start a reflection session for the focus session. The questions for the reflection are customizable for your personal taste. After the reflection you can choose to start a new session, schedule a new session for later, make a break or finish working. The reminders created by this shortcut will be marked as complete automatically when you run the shortcut from the links inside the reminders. You can just start using the BE PRODUCTIVE BOTCUT without customizing and see if it works for you with the default settings or read through the customization options at the beginning of the shortcut to customize it to your needs. During Automation April I combined several Shortcuts I used into this single shortcut and came up with the idea to use dictionaries as inputs to distinguish different actions in a single shortcuts with different input parameters in the dictionary depending on the intended action. Running the Shortcut with those parameters from Reminders does not require any Third-Party apps which I wanted to make it usable for as many people as possible. WARNING: When you change the name of the shortcut (or just duplicate it to make your own modifications) you have to adapt the name in the configuration text in user define ‚Äû5)‚Äú GET THE SHORTCUT LinkCut LinkCut ‚Äì a Shortcut to easily store / retrieve often used (markdown) links. LinkCut was designed as an easy to use Shortcut to either store or retrieve links in the required format. Links will be stored in the Shortcuts directory of iCloud Drive. This enables usage of LinkCut without any Third Party App and it works right out of the box. Because of iCloud sync you‚Äôll have your stored links available on all your devices. Usage of LinkCut If you share any link via the ShareSheet to this Shortcut (on iOS/iPadOS) you can store this link in the LinkCut directory to quickly retrieve it later (on any of your devices). To store a Link you first need to choose an existing (or create a new) category and give the link a title ‚Äì this title will also be used as title when you later retrieve it and copy the md url. Note: On the Mac you can store links, too. If you run this shortcut on a mac (with no provided input) it will ask you if you want to retrieve or store a link. If you select to store a link, the frontmost webpage in safari will be used ‚Äì this is working as expected when Safari is the active window ‚Äì with Safari in the background this could lead to errors out of my control. It is totally fine to store a link in two (or more) categories, this is entirely up to you. If you run this Shortcut from a widget / the Shortcuts app or a Launcher App without an input, you can select a category and then one or more links from that category. LinkCut offers different options to interact with selected links: remove them from the store open them copy the url(s) copy the markdown url(s) If the Shortcut detects that you either selected an empty category or removed the last link from a category you‚Äôll have the option to delete the category, too. LinkCuts interacts only with files in its folder and will ask for permissions to access / store / delete files especially when you use it the first time(s). How LinkCut works Under the hood LinkCut uses markdown files which are stored in the Shortcuts directory of LinkCut at the specified path (below). Each category is represented by a single markdwon file. If you want to store (or remove) a lot of links you also can edit the markdown files in the directory and add your markdown formatted links directly into the file. Please ensure that you don‚Äôt insert empty lines in the file (also not at the end after the last link) GET THE SHORTCUT"

The following unprioritized list helps me to conquer FOMO on a daily basis ‚Äì not meaning that I solved this problem for myself [1] ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ALLOW YOURSELF TO MISS INFORMATION Its impossible to process all information we see. You can‚Äôt read / watch / listen to everything. Accept that and allow yourself to miss information. You will be fell less tempted to store everything on endless checklists. [2] ‚úÖ MARK EVERYTHING AS READ (sometimes) Being offline for a bit ‚Äì the unread counter of your feed may overwhelm you ‚Äì you may never have the time to dig through all of it. Maybe this is the time to just scroll to the top and mark everything as read. [3] ‚ùå DON‚ÄôT READ EVERY ARTICLE IN YOUR FEED(s) If you‚Äôre like me you may have many great blogs in your RSS feed. Make sure to don‚Äôt open every link. Screening the headlines should be sufficent to decide if this article is relevant and valuable for you or not! [4] üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è CHOOSE YOUR SOURCES WISLEY ‚Äì DO THEY ADD VALUE TO YOUR LIFE? We tend to follow more feeds than we (ever) can read. Reevaluate regularly if a source is still valuable for you ‚Äì maybe remove it for a week and see if you miss anything. [5] ü§î ASK WHY YOU‚ÄôRE READING THIS ‚Äì YOU‚ÄôRE ALLOWED TO ABORT IT I often read articles completely even when I asked myself ‚Äì not even half through it ‚Äì if if its really meaningful for me. Try to change that and abort reading an article if I don‚Äôt like it. [6] üîÄ USE CROSS-READING (SKIMMING) It‚Äôs really helpful to cross-read / skim posts. This massively decreases the time you need to find what you‚Äôre hoping for in that article or you can skip it faster when nothing really attrackts you. Don‚Äôt cross-read / skim your most valuable sources! [7] üèó CREATE NOT CONSUME We don‚Äôt learn while consuming ‚Äì we learn when we articulate knowledge in our own words. I heard the ‚ÄúCREATE NOT CONSUME‚Äù mindset in an episode of the @_focusedfm podcast. How can you integrate the knowledge you read into your own work? [8] ü§ù CREATE RULES This applies to nearly every [point] I‚Äôm writing here. Create rules for yourself and try to stick to them. You can limit the unread counters or articles read on each day ‚Äì just look whats working for you and adapt from time to time if needed. [9] üßò USE FOCUS MODES / RESTRICT NOTIFICATIONS Interuptions are the killers of every focused work session. Try focus modes on your devices to restrict notifications in certain contexts. This helps to stay focused on the work that matters for you. [10] üì± SET SCREEN TIME LIMITS Screen time limits are helpful to reflect on the time you spent in apps. If you set a limit of 30min to an app and iOS will block access ‚Äì you‚Äôll learn how to use the time more wisely. Stick to the limits as good as you can. [11] üîï MUTE THINGS Mute things you don‚Äôt want to read anymore. This could be keywords in @tweetbot, a group chat / channel or an ‚Äúunfollow‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt see the unread counter you won‚Äôt try to read messages / tweets that aren‚Äôt valuable for you anyways. [12] üíî (TRY) TO IGNORE THE LIKE COUNTS We all thrive to get as many likes / reactions / retweets as possible. We want to be liked and hope that our work is valuable for others. We measure it with like counts but is that true? [13] üìµ MAKE YOUR PHONE UNREACHABLE Our phones are a major distraction for focused work and if our mind wanders we are likely to grab it and just check what happened. Don‚Äôt have your phone next to you all the time. [14] üí≠ THINK IF YOU NEED TO ANSWER (IMMEDIATELY) Instant messaging apps want us to answer immediately to messages / comments. Think before responding to complex requests if it‚Äôs necessary to answer immediately or later if you have time. [15] ü´£ DON‚ÄôT LOOK AT YOUR PHONE OUT OF BOREDOM If you‚Äôre bored don‚Äôt use your phone to refresh your feeds every 2 minutes. Use it intentionally to create something great üòä [16] ‚èØ BE IN THE MOMENT Our time on earth / with friends and family is limited ‚Äì enjoy the moments with your full presence. Enjoy moments of silence and loneliness in the nature"

      "url": "/11ty_test/draftist-a-drafts-action-group-for-todoist/",
      "content": "Finally I can launch a project I wanted to do for quite a while. After a few months of work I‚Äôm happy to release Draftist ‚Äì a Drafts Action Group for integrating Drafts with Todoist. A bit of background Drafts is one of my most used App on all devices. If I had to pick a favorite app it would be a hard pick between Drafts, Craft and Todoist ‚Äì luckily I don‚Äôt need to üòâ Drafts made it easy to quickly throw tasks into Todoist without actually opening it which 1) speeds up adding tasks and 2) removed friction since I don‚Äôt see anything else but a blank draft when I quickly add tasks. I digged deeper into the rabbit hole of automating Todoist with Drafts early to e.g. simply switch labels of tasks or resolve waiting4 items by using the Scripting API of Drafts for Todoist. While this was really helpful for myself it always was a bit hacky and put together with a lot of duck tape. This was working fine but what bothered me was that I could not share this with other users since it simply was too complicated to configure and maintain. Additionally I did not document the Actions I built for myself very well which only complicated sharing possibilities. Therefore I never shared more complex automations for Todoist with Drafts in the past. Earlier this year I decided I want to change this and after the success of Craftist it was only a matter of finding time to built an Action Group for Todoist from the ground up. After a few months of work I finally released the first version. What is Draftist Draftist is an Action Group you can download from the action directory of Drafts to install it in your Drafts application. It contains a bunch of Actions to integrate Drafts with Todoist ‚Äì starting from very basic ones to quickly add tasks to your account (with or without settings) to very complex ones like importing of tasks or modifying labels or due dates. Since everyone uses Todoist differently I wanted to develop Draftist very flexible to adapt to everyone‚Äôs needs by both ‚Äì keeping it simple to configure and easy to use at the same time. I also wanted to make sure I can imorove or add features and fix issues easily. Which is why I created Draftist as a single source file which contains all the necessary functions which is loaded in all the Actions. The Draftist.js file is maintained in the public GitHub repository of Draftist and downloaded by the Draftist Setup/Update Action into the Drafts directory in iCloud Drive. Using a single source file and building Actions from those functions allows two things: Actions can be duplicated and configured differently very easily Experienced Scripting users can actually use the functions I implemented to create extended workflows for their own by just including the Draftist Action into theirs. Since Draftist is interacting with the Todoist API and some of the Actions load your project / label names to create tasks in projects or assign labels the Actions require an internet connection. I wanted to prevent endless loading times when users often create Tasks with settings and therefore came up with the solution to store the data of labels, projects and sections (but thats for later) in a file in your iCloud Drive. This is updated once a day by default but you can configure this to be faster or slower. This (massively) speeds up the process and also reduces the amounts of requests Draftist makes to the Todoist API. To ensure the user is always in control you can force a sync of the Todoist data with the update local Todoist data Action (if a user created a new project and wants to immideately use it with Draftist). The user defined settings are also stored in a file in your iCloud Drive directory. A nice benefit of this is that the settings (and Todoist data) are synced between your devices via iCloud and users don‚Äôt need to do anything about this. What can I do with Draftist Draftist intends to simplify your repeating workflows and remove frictions from processes. This starts with a couple of Actions to easily create tasks from a Draft in Todoist. You can quickly note or brainstorm tasks into a Draft and then run an Action to e.g. create a new task for each line in the current draft (either using Todoist quick add syntax or manually selecting the settings for the tasks from prompts). Next you can import Tasks into the current Draft ‚Äì this is possible for simple things like importing the todays tasks, or tasks from a project to more complicated user defined filters. I also built a few more complex Actions which let you modify existing tasks. You can update the labels or due dates of tasks you select (Draftist shows the options from a filter in a prompt), resolve or delete tasks and one thing I constantly use is to duplicate tasks with switching a label (e.g. from @waiting4 to @followUP). Several Actions in Draftist seem to be duplicates but this is actually intended. Some Actions just present a prompt where you can e.g. type in the tasks you have in mind and send them to Todoist (without creating a new Draft at all) and others allow you to predefined things like a filter which should be used by the action to e.g. always present you the tasks from the filter ‚Äútoday‚Äù in a prompt to select tasks. The nice thing is, that you can duplicate and rename those Actions without breaking anything and use it with different configurations. I recommend you to create your own (blank) Action Group e.g. named ‚Äúmy Draftist‚Äù and use the Draftist Action Replicator Action to duplicate the Actions you want into your own Draftist Action Group. There you can then configure and rename them to your preference and the original Draftist Action Group remains untouched. I know the setup might seem a bit tricky but really thats the most simple setup I could imagine. To help users remove the initial barriers I plan to record some videos to show you how to setup Draftist and also how to configure and use the Actions. If you have specific usecases which you would like to see or struggle with the setup ‚Äì please let me know. What are the future plans for Draftist This is only the first step for Draftist and I have a few other ideas I can implement for users. I want to support even more specific usecases and probably also integrating / crosslinking with other Third Party apps. I‚Äôm also thinking about Actions to create projects / sections. I would love to hear your needs which hopefully can be replicated with Draftist. Again ‚Äì just let me know what you‚Äôre up to. I hope that Draftist simplyfies and speeds up many of your workflows and helps to remove friction from your processes. Let me know what you are thinking üöÄ Where to get Draftist You can download the Action Group from the Drafts Action directory: Draftist Action Group The code and also all Action Descriptions and Instructions are hosted in the Draftist GitHub repository Make sure to run the Draftist Setup/Update Action after downloading the Action Group into your Drafts App."

      "content": "This week I had the opportunity to write about my desk setup on MacStories Weekly. Read through the details in my setup below if you‚Äôre interested. Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è I‚Äôm Floh, a productivity and note-making (read taking) enthusiast and Software Developer from Germany üá©üá™. I develop software in my day job and during my free time, where my goal is to remove friction from processes and workflows for myself and others. My setup evolved quite a bit during the pandemic since this was the first time I had to work from home in my day job. I started with only my Laptop / MacBook on our dining table. But working from home with my wife in the same room distracted us from our work. That‚Äôs why I build a new desk setup in our bedroom (right between my part of the closet and our bed). We‚Äôre tied up in the Windows universe at our jobs but only use Apple products when we work in our free time. The setup relies on Thunderbolt / USB-C and Bluetooth to connect to the peripherals. I use my good old 13‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro from 2017, which I bought from the Apple Refurbished Store (Specs: 3.1 GHz Intel Core i5 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage). I will switch to Apple Silicon at some point in the future, but I‚Äôm pretty happy with it for now. The main display is a DELL U2520D with 25‚Ä≥ ‚Äì I know it could be bigger (read wider) but its enough most of the times. To let my MacBook serve as a secondary display, I wanted to lift it a bit. There are brilliant solutions available, but I haven‚Äôt decided how I want to set this up in the future. Right now, I use our Exploding Kittens card game to raise it üòÑ (this is not a joke, but I hope you‚Äôre laughing right now). Don‚Äôt judge me for not cleaning my MacBooks screen before taking the photos ‚ò∫Ô∏è The CalDigit TS3+ serves as a dock to connect my MacBook (or other devices) with the peripherals. It connects webcam (Logitech C920s PRO HD), wired Ethernet, display, keyboard, and mouse when they need charging. I also use it to connect external drives for video material. Speaking of keyboard and mouse: I use the Keychron K4 Version 2 (with Gateron Red Switches) and the Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac. I miss both when working with other input devices at work or the MacBook alone. I would consider myself a keyboard guy but using the extra buttons of the MX Master is beneficial in many Apps. Assigning app-specific actions or keyboard shortcuts speeds up and simplifies many workflows. I built a wooden wrist raiser by myself that eliminates pain in my wrist when typing a lot. Although we have active hobbies (like mountain biking), we would still sit too much at a desk. So we assembled a height-adjustable desk with a boho office Basic Line frame and a table plate from IKEA (that I fluffed a bit in the past). The desk frame allows for storing four positions. Now both of us can save the perfect height for sitting and standing. All cables are tucked away in a cable tray and a slim line down to the bottom. The chair needs some time to get used to, but I like it, and it almost always prevents me from lurking around. The last Apple device on my desk is my 9th generation iPad, nothing special here. I use it with Universal Control from time to time but at most for reading and making notes when I‚Äôm not at my desk. While working, I listen to music most of the time, which helps me to focus (my edmFocus playlist). I use the original Libratone ZIPP (the one without Alexa built-in), which is sitting next to me. I attached an NFC tag to quickly hand over the playback via Shortcuts (if I‚Äôm not using a more complex Shortcut). You can also see what I meant writing about the messed-up desk plate in the corner. When I assembled the desk with its associated frame from IKEA, I didn‚Äôt read the instructions (who does ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). I forgot some spacers, the screw pierced the plate, and now I have four stripes of white tape on the back side of the desk to hide those holes üòÖ. My goal with this setup was to have a flexible working space that works with all our devices and looks clean. I‚Äôm pretty happy with it so far. This setup supports me with volunteering work, and I enjoy developing scripts, extensions, and workflows for my most used tools (Drafts, Craft, Todoist, and DEVONthink). That‚Äôs it! If you have any questions about the setup or the tools I created, feel free to ask me in the MacStories Discord or on Twitter."

      "content": "Something has changed on my phone ‚Äì to be precise in the dock of my iPhone. An App I started using nearly two years ago got exchanged and went back to the App Library. Some of you already seen the Tweet ‚Äì I moved my notes from Craft to Obsidian a few weeks after the launch of Obsidian 1.0. I want to explain a bit why I decided to switch and move my notes to Obsidian. Disclaimer: I‚Äòm just sharing my personal opinion and ‚Äûfeelings‚Äú. This post is just to explain why I switched and not meant to be offending criticism of Craft or the great team behind it. I‚Äòll start with the biggest issue in the last months for me: I‚Äòm unhappy with the development path of Craft. They stopped doing what I really loved about the app: Prioritizing native development for iOS and macOS. Honestly I think that the team still is pushing hard to develop the apps there to the limit but there is a clear shift in the last year. After releasing the web-version they also launched the windows version a couple weeks back. This goes also hand-in-hand with the focus on growing the user-base by becoming cross-platform and focusing a lot on business features. A year ago I was excited about each and every update. Like many others I was eagerly waiting for the next update with new features and improvements to the app. I read all details in the What‚Äôs New document. Nowadays I‚Äòm not excited anymore, I don‚Äòt read through the whole document and many updates didn‚Äòt bring stuff thats necessary &amp; important for me and my usecases. Actually the latest Update (2.3.7) which iterates tables is interesting and long overdue, but doesn‚Äòt change my general feelings. This brings me to my next big issue: The Craft eXtensions developer platform. The API got released in the end of last year and the team and many users where very excited (myself included). I started developing my first eXtension and learned a lot during that process. I really enjoyed developing Craftist for Todoist and Craftcuts for Shortcuts and got a lot of great feedback (and support). Since then there was no update for the API for stuff which is really necessary. The team made a brave move and started to rethink the API but there was no update on that process since then ‚Äì also no timeline. So we don‚Äòt know if and when a new version of that API will be released. This is really disappointing for me given the enthusiasm we all had at the beginning. We have no idea when we will be able to add custom features to Craft that we need with powerful eXtensions. Kind of related to the API is also the issue for me that awesome native stuff like proper support for Apple Shortcuts with improved Actions for the Craft app are still not implemented. I (and several other users) requested those updates with concrete suggestions several times but also nothing happened on that end since more than a year. Sure Obsidian also doesn‚Äòt offer Shortcuts Actions but the file-based approach enables a lot of automation / integration without native Shortcut Actions. Without the PROs of a native first App and due to my personal feelings Obsidian for me is worth the try and probably the better choice: bigger community, powerful API, many available (advanced) plugins and the Obsidian 1.0 release on iOS also changed the experience a lot. Additionally of course there is the encrypted sync with zero-knowledge of the obsidian Team which is also a big plus on that end. When I tested the exported markdown data from Craft in Obsidian I also noticed that a few things are still Craft specific and needed manual changes which kind of counts against the ‚ÄûYour Data is Yours‚Äú approach from Craft ‚Äì many links to other notes needed adaptions and all links to daily notes where still in the Craft-specific format. Other than that the switch was pretty easy and I just did everything on my iPhone with the help of Shortcuts (and a lot of processing time :D). If you‚Äôre interested in that, let me know and I‚Äòll maybe do a write-up üôÇ While I‚Äòm still on the road and traveling I‚Äòll explore the mobile experience of Obsidian and test it further if it really fits my needs, but until know I‚Äòm pretty happy with it! Of course I have to adapt some of my workflows and automations (looking forward to share them with you) but I adapted a few of them very quickly to work with Obsidian instead of Craft now. This switch doesn‚Äòt mean that I will completely stop using Craft ‚Äì there are some features especially the collaboration and sharing of documents which are simpler than anything else I know and for those I‚Äòll keep using Craft and move the documents to Obsidian when no collaboration or sharing is needed anymore. In the end I just want to say that I really love the Craft community and the people at Craft that I had a few chats with. You‚Äòre doing a great job to care for the community and I‚Äòm sure that its hard to balance all the different requests from users with the product strategy. Special thanks to Tom Norman the community manager! I‚Äòll hang around with you guys and help where I can üôÇ The Craft eXtensions I built still work and I will maintain them ‚Äì if there is a new API one day then I need to check how much work it will be to migrate the extensions but thats something for later.

      "content": "TL;DR What you need to do: ‚Äì export all documents ‚Äì fix daily note links using regular expressions ‚Äì create tags from tag documents (optional) ‚Äì fix illegal characters in filenames, -paths and links In my last post A new Home for my Personal Notes I explained why I decided to move my notes from Craft to Obsidian. A few readers reached out to learn how I performed that switch. In general I would recommend that you define a clear ‚Äúcut‚Äú between the two apps if you still want to use both. Additionally I think it‚Äòs important to do the switch on one day to don‚Äòt have overlapping and inconsistent usage of both apps because no system is working properly anymore. Choose a day when you have time to make the switch ‚Äì depending on your skills and amount of notes this might take just 30 minutes or up to a few hours. Since I‚Äòm traveling right now and don‚Äòt have access to my Mac I did everything on my iPhone ‚Äì the process should be easier (and faster) when you use a Mac but basically you need to make the same adaptions. These posts on Reddit and in the Obsidian forum might be helpful for you, too. The first step of course was to export the notes from Craft. To do so you can tap the three dots icon in the upper left corner. Select ‚ÄûExport (All Documents)‚Äú and then ‚ÄûMarkdown‚Äú as shown in the screenshots below (actually the latest Craft Update changed something in that process since I was able to select the markdown format in the next prompt ‚Äì do not use the Craft format there, I used the GitHub/Notable/iA Writer option). Depending on the amount of notes you have in Craft this might take a while (I think it was more than an hour for me). I stored the finished export locally on my iPhone and moved it to the Obsidian folder (On My iPhone/Obsidian). Of course you need to install the Obsidian App first so that folder will appear. I strongly recommend to make a backup from that folder immediately (just duplicate and rename it). You can already launch the Obsidian App and choose to open the exported folder as vault in Obsidian but there several things in the documents that need adaption before they will be really useful in Obsidian. The most obvious are the links to daily notes. Craft uses a specific format e.g. [Tue 23. Aug](day://2022.08.23) for these links. You definitely don‚Äòt want to fix all of them manually but luckily we can use a regular expression for that ‚Äì I always use regex101 to develop and test regex. We can find all daily links in a file by using the following regex: \\[.*?\\]\\(day:\\/\\/(\\d{4}).(\\d{2}).(\\d{2})\\) To change the format we need to substitute it into the format we want to have the dates. I wanted to change all daily notes to use a format like ‚ÄûYYYY-MM-DD‚Äú. Since Craft exports the daily notes with dots instead of dashes this also would require to rename all the daily notes. For whatever reason I was not able to rename those files in Shortcuts with a ‚Äû.md‚Äú file extension at the end so I stick with ‚ÄûYYYY.MM.DD‚Äú‚Äú for now and will change it to my beloved format when I have access to my Mac again. The regex already includes so called ‚Äûgroups‚Äú for the year, month and date that allow you to access them easily. To change the format to ‚ÄûYYYY-MM-DD‚Äú you need to replace all matches of the regex with [[$1-$2-$3]]. If you do so, make sure to also rename all the files in the exported folder with this regex and substitution: (\\d{4}).(\\d{2}).(\\d{2}) with $1-$2-$3 If you also want to use Shortcuts for that purpose You‚Äòll find a link to the one I used at the end (including the other adaptions I made) but I‚Äòd recommend to use the Mac for that with apps like TextMate, Sublime Text, BBEdit or most IDEs like Visual Studio Code. Now we already made a big step forward ‚Äì all the links to Daily Notes should work again in Obsidian ‚Äì maybe just check it by opening the graph view ‚Äì you should see connections for the Daily Notes here: This was the easier part. Craft didn‚Äôt offer native tags that‚Äòs why I used standalone documents and treated them as tags (by the way a great read about using tags, links, folders and so on: All you need is links). These documents all had the same format for their title #[tagname] and where stored in the same folder in my Craft space [resources]/tags/. The links to those documents didn‚Äòt work properly for me and I also wanted to convert them to real tags in Obsidian. I needed to change all links to tag documents that looked like this [[[resources]/tags/#[tagname]]] to just the hashtags #[tagname]. Again a regex substitution helps us to do that substitution. Please note that you will need to adapt this to your own structure in Craft. If you created the tag documents similar than I did at least you need to change the path to the documents do match your structure in Craft. Again I used regex101 to develop and test the regular expression for my needs. Just copy over a few different links to the editor of regex101 and build the regex. I did the substitution in two steps ‚Äì first I removed the path to the tags (and also other documents in the [resources] folder) with this regex: \\[resources\\]\\/[a-z]*\\/ and replaced it with an empty string. The (most) links to the documents in that folder should work without further adaption. One exception are illegal or unsupported characters in file-paths or -names. Which will be covered later. In my structure the links to ‚Äûtag documents‚Äú now looked like this [[#[tagname]]] but they don‚Äòt work and also are not displayed as tags in Obsidian. To change this we need to remove the brackets ‚Äì we can use a regex replacement again: When we replace \\[\\[#(.*?)\\]\\] with #$1 in all files the links will be changed to tags recognized by Obsidian: #[tagname]. After that replacement you can open your vault and check the tags view ‚Äì your tags should now appear here. This is already a great starting point to explore your notes in Obsidian. I found out that quite a lot of links worked out of the box and didn‚Äòt need adaption ‚Äì even links to blocks inside of other notes from Craft seemed to work. I didn‚Äòt go through all my documents to check all of them. Instead I‚Äòm doing it iteratively now. When I open existing notes then I can always check if the links are still working ‚Äì you can distinguish it easily by looking at the color of the link. If its displayed in a bright color then the link points to an existing document. If the color looks not bright that means the linked document couldn‚Äòt be found be Obsidian. You can see the example in the following screenshot. Now you have to search for the exact problem with the link. In almost all of the dead-end-links i found this was related to the file name which contained illegal characters for Obsidian. Files are (unfortunately)not allowed to contain /,\\ or :. If one of those characters is in the link then Obsidian will not find the correct file. You need to change the filename and adapt the link afterwards. I was not able to do this via Shortcuts since renaming and storing them as .md file didn‚Äòt work on my iPhone. I would recommend to search for files with those characters in the finder or an other IDE to change all of them. This is only necessary if you have files with those characters. Since I imported highlights from articles I read I have a few files that mostly contain a :. If you don‚Äòt have such files you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems. After fixing the filename and link, it should be displayed in a bright color. The same problem can occur when you create new notes and want to link them to some of your old ones. If you type [[]], search and select an exisitng note it might happen that Obsidian creates the link but it is again a dead-end. If that happens then make sure to check for illegal characters in the filename. Sometimes the path to the file (folder / subfolders) might also contain an illegal character. This is the most frustrating part of the migration but maybe someone can point me to another possible solution that I can link here. You can also check your Obsidian graph to see the recognized connections between notes and also check for orphan dots (notes) that you already linked in Craft. Just open the note by selecting the edge in your graph and check for the dead-end links in it. A last and easy step is to reuse your templates that you created in Craft. The templates folder of Craft is also exported. You‚Äòll find all your templates in the My Templates folder in your vault. You can either keep the name or rename it depending on your preferences. I renamed mine to templates and pointed the Core Plugin for Templates to that folder. Now I can use the templates I created for Craft in Obsidian. Some might need adaptions because not all stylings that are available in Craft are not supported by Obsidian. Just open the corresponding file and remove the styling markers. This especially affects highlight colors that are exported as ::highlighted text::. You need to change the colons to equal signs in Obsidian: ==highlighted text== These are the steps I took to migrate from Craft to Obsidian. As mentioned I did the entire process on my iPhone since I don‚Äòt have access to a Mac right now. As I already mentioned I used a Shortcut to do those regex substitutions. You can download it here but you need to make some adaptions to it depending on your folder structure in the exported documents. You need to change the ‚ÄúGet contents of folder‚Äú and ‚Äúsave file‚Äú steps to use the folder of your Obsidian Vault (reminder: please make a backup before running this). You also have to change the path to the folder in the second text step manually (you can e.g. use the ‚ÄúGet Info‚Äú option from the context menu of one of the files in your vault folder to find out that path. Use it of course at your own risk and the shortcut took more than 3h to complete for me to process all 700+ files in my export. I hope this post helps you if you want to move from Craft to Obsidian ‚Äì if you have questions or ideas to improve the process just let me know üôå If this post helped you to migrate from Craft to Obsidian you can support my work with a few coffees ‚òïÔ∏è: FlohGro Donate. Appreciate the support! In the next posts I‚Äòll share some automations that eases adding content to Obsidian from Drafts. You can also follow me on Twitter where I share these Actions earlier."

      "content": "Along with many others I significantly reduced my usage of Twitter recently and switchted my activities to the shiny ‚Äúnew‚Äù Mastodon. You can find me at @FlohGro on social.lol if you want to follow me. I was using a few Actions for Twitter in Drafts that I immideatly missed after I made the move to the Fediverse. After downloading some Actions from Drafts Action Directory I couldn‚Äôt resist to think about combining all of them to an easy to use Action Group with even more features than all the current Actions. So I started developing and after hours (I didn‚Äôt count them) of work I was happy to release Draftodon an Action Group dedicated to integrate Drafts with Mastodon. The Action Group has an easy setup procedure (you need to download the underlying Draftodon.js file with an Action and configure your mastodon instance and user handle in the Draftodon Settings Action) so hopefully anybody can use it. After doing the setup Draftodon enables you to post or schedule posts, polls and posts with content warnings. You can also publish threads if you want to write more than the character limit allows. I didn‚Äôt stop there and also implemented Actions that allow you to view and edit scheduled posts (delete / change the schedule). I also included some useful helpers to insert often used hashtags or handles of users you want to mention regularly in your posts. After some initial problems for early adopters (my bad ‚Äì in case you‚Äôre interested: I directly linked the Draftodon Action in my Action Group which is not working for shared Action Groups ‚Äì there you have to use the Template string in the ‚ÄúInclude Action‚Äù step) I already released a small update to Draftodon to allow configuration of post visibilities to address a user request. Draftodon relies on a JavaScript file that you install with the Draftodon Setup / Update Action, which stores the file in the Drafts folder of your iCloud Drive directory in the subpath /Library/Scripts. The Draftodon.js is versioned in the corresponding Draftodon GitHub repository which allows me to push bugfixes and small updates to functions without the need of updating the whole Action Group. I really enjoy working on that Action Group so if you have any further requests, questions or issues with it ‚Äì please reach out to me on Mastodon If you‚Äôre not yet using Draftodon but want to check it out ‚Äì start by downloading the Action Group and read through the instruction to set everything up Get Draftodon I hope Draftodon is a helpful tool for you and speeds up many of your workflows and processes. Whats next? I have a few requests that I‚Äôll be working on: integrate an Action that allows you to reply to other posts (refer to this action) cover issues with authentication (sometimes Drafts is not authenticated properly but a credential will be creadet which needs a manual reset) improve parts of the documentation (more prominently mention that the template tag names must not be changed) find an easy solution to use Draftodon with mulitple accounts If you like the Action Group I would appreciate if you share that you‚Äôre using it on Mastodon, boost my posts about it (e.g. launch of Draftodon 1.1) and consider to support my work by donating"

I was very excited about that because there are many use cases for AI within Drafts. Summarization, creation of ideas, spell-checking, translation or simply answering questions ‚Äì you name it. I created a few actions using the scripting API for myself which were very useful for me. I wanted to enable more users without scripting knowledge to create their own actions to be used with this integration. It took me a while to figure out what could be a solution by being flexible enough at the same time. I released the AI Tools action group today. It contains a few ready-to-use actions and a template action to easily create actions for your own use cases. My idea was to create a template action that users can duplicate and then configure for their own purposes. The action has three important configuration options that define what ‚Äúquestion‚Äù is sent to ChatGPT with the option to include ‚Äúinput text‚Äù that e.g. should be translated and of course tell the underlying script, what to do with the response text from ChatGPT. The configuration is done with the so-called ‚ÄúDefine Template Tag‚Äù steps in the action. They contain the available options so you can easily choose what you want. The action group description in the Drafts directory contains detailed information, on what the different options mean. If you want to try the AI Tools and create your own, just download the action group from the directory and make sure to read through the docs before using any of the actions or create your own. I really hope that the AI Tools action group is helpful for you and enables users to create helpful AI-powered actions for themselves without the need to script on their own. I would be interested to hear what you enjoy, what you dislike, and most importantly what use cases you created for yourself. I would be happy to hear from you on Mastodon. Under the hood the action runs another action from the action group which is not visible in the list that contains the full script ‚Äì if you‚Äôre interested you can have a look at the action by navigating into the ‚Äúmanage action groups panel‚Äù and look for the ‚ÄúAIToolBuilderScript‚Äù action.

I believe that if you decide to support something I do, you should get all the benefits, no matter how much you pay.‚Äú ‚Äì Manuel Moreale I totally agree with his belief in kindness, but as Robb also put it in his post I don‚Äôt want to paywall the things I make, those are better served being available to everyone‚Äú ‚Äì Robb Knight This has always been my approach and people who benefit from things I develop get ‚Äûnothing‚Äú but the satisfaction of making me smile. Of course there are regular costs (e.g. this website or the great social.lol instance on Mastodon by omg.lol) but the most expensive thing of course is my own time. I love creating tools and helping people improve and simplify their workflows so I never paywalled these things. On the other hand it‚Äôs really great to get some appreciation and a little compensation of the costs. In short: I added (or changed) membership tiers on my ko-fi and buymeacoffee to 1$ a month. I also changed the minimum amount to 1$ to join the people Jarrod listed on oneamonth.club. Nothing will change about the stuff I create and share, but if you want to support me on a regular basis, you can do so at the lowest possible cost. I really appreciate every single support I receive, replies / boosts on Mastodon, kind words via email and of course everyone who wants to support One a Month. Thank you!"

Bookmarks don‚Äôt work for me especially on iOS with the different Safari profiles that I use. These profiles are just not accessible enough on the iPhone. Of course I created a Drafts action to solve this problem for me. QuickLink Opener allows me to configure links that I often open in a simple configuration draft where I categorise them into different sections. When I want to open one of the configured links I just hit the action and select the category + url that I want to open. I immediately added the action to my Drafts widget in the Today View on iOS ‚Äì to get really easy access to it. ‚û°Ô∏è GET THE ACTION"

      "content": "Using Shortcuts and a Drafts Action you can automate the import of highlights from Readwise Reader into Drafts once a day. I absolutely enjoy using Readwise Reader as my RSS and read later service. However, I wanted to make the most of my highlights by importing them into Drafts for review and processing. A while back, I created the import latest Readwise highlights action, which pulls all the new highlights into Drafts. The only downside was having to manually run this action, which was quite inconvenient and in the end of course didn‚Äôt work out.. Luckily there is a solution to automatically run this action once every day using Shortcuts. My first attempt to set it up as a scheduled automation didn‚Äôt work since running the action requires Drafts to be opened. This isn‚Äôt always possible, especially when the device is locked. However, I found an effective workaround that involved setting up a personal automation to log the last time Drafts was opened in a file. This enables Shortcuts to determine whether Drafts had been opened that day and trigger the import action accordingly. Testing it for the first time ‚Äì I quickly noticed that the original action for importing highlights always loaded a Draft into the editor, potentially disrupting your workflow. To address this issue, I created a modified version of the action specifically for automated execution. This tweaked version imports the new highlights without interfering with your tasks. If you‚Äôre interested in automating the process of importing Readwise highlights or any other action you (want to) run on a regular basis, here is what you need to do: Get the import latest Readwise highlights (automated) action (of course this is not necessary if you want to run another action) Download and set up the Import Reading Highlights Drafts Automation Shortcut (you need to select the action you want to run during installation). Create a personal automation in Shortcuts that triggers the Shortcut as soon as you open Drafts."

      "url": "/11ty_test/drafts-46-automate/",
      "content": "Drafts Version 46 was released today. In this post, I will highlight new features and my personal highlights of the release. A few weeks ago I dipped my toes into Syntax development for Drafts. I have no need to make big changes but I wanted to define some custom link definitions to e.g. run an action with [[r:process INBOX]]or open a tag filter with [[t:project::active]] ‚Äì it is also published to the directory (and I maintain it in the respective GitHub repository). When I added those link definitions I quickly noticed that the URL scheme that the /search URL scheme did default to the inbox folder in Drafts. What I wanted was to directly jump to the all folder to see every draft tagged with the given tag. After requesting the additional parameter it was added with this release and it works great. Now you can pass a folder parameter to force switching the folder tab in the draft list. E.g. drafts://search?tag=project&amp;folder=all will filter the drafts list for all drafts tagged with project. I use this e.g. in my Weekly Review checklist together with the mentioned syntax it is easily possible to quickly filter for all drafts that are tagged with project::active. Another way I use this is to link to special searches from routine tasks in Todoist that open a specific predefined search. While I don‚Äôt have a big personal use for it right now a new feature in Drafts 46 is Text-to-Speech. The described use case in the forum e.g. as snippet library for often used phrases for verbally challenged users is an exceptionally great example. I appreciate that features like this are added to Drafts and extend its capabilities in ways I never thought about. If you want to find out more about this have a look at the guide which also includes some example actions that are ready to use to e.g. read the currently selected text. My favorite new feature however is the new ‚ÄúRun Action in Background‚Äù shortcuts action. In fact, these are two new actions to either run a Drafts action on a given draft or on a provided text (which can be empty). This allows triggering Drafts‚Äô actions from shortcuts without making Drafts the active app. A few months ago I found a (tacky) solution to automate importing my Readwise highlights into Drafts. With this release, you can now create a scheduled automation that runs Drafts actions at a specific time of the day. Another example could be a tickler file action as discussed in this forum thread. The background execution has some restrictions. Actions that require user interactions (e.g. responding to a prompt) will not work ‚Äì as stated in the release notes Drafts will try to not display actions when you select the action in the Shortcuts editor but since evaluating this e.g. for scripted actions is not an easy task this is not bulletproof. If you have a use case I recommend just trying to run the Action from a Shortcut without setting up the automation first. Then double-check if you see the expected result in Drafts and set up the automation afterward. The potential for this feature is big! If you‚Äôre using Daily Notes you can let Drafts create that note daily (or weekly/monthly) in the background and once you open the app they will already be there. I will try to automate posting quotes to Mastodon with this feature. Of course, this is not only relevant for automation, this can also be used to run Drafts actions in other shortcuts. Another solid release of Drafts ‚Äì if you want to dive into the discussions of the new release head over to the announcement in the forum. I‚Äôm interested in your use cases for the new Run Action in Background shortcuts action step ‚Äì whether as automation or integrated into any other shortcut. Share them in the forum or send them over to me on Mastodon or Bluesky."
