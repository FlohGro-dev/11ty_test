Summarization, creation of ideas, spell-checking, translation or simply answering questions ‚Äì you name it. I created a few actions using the scripting API for myself which were very useful for me. I wanted to enable more users without scripting knowledge to create their own actions to be used with this integration. It took me a while to figure out what could be a solution by being flexible enough at the same time.</p>\n<p>I released the <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/g/2PG\">AI Tools</a> action group today. It contains a few ready-to-use actions and a template action to easily create actions for your own use cases.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flohgro.com/new-site/assets/CleanShot-2024-01-16-at-00.34.-1ZHIXUrqrp0q.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My idea was to create a template action that users can duplicate and then configure for their own purposes. The action has three important configuration options that define what ‚Äúquestion‚Äù is sent to ChatGPT with the option to include ‚Äúinput text‚Äù that e.g. should be translated and of course tell the underlying script, what to do with the response text from ChatGPT. The configuration is done with the so-called ‚ÄúDefine Template Tag‚Äù steps in the action. They contain the available options so you can easily choose what you want. The action group description in the Drafts directory contains detailed information, on what the different options mean.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flohgro.com/new-site/assets/CleanShot-2024-01-16-at-00.34.-MLSaMzpyokyx.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you want to try the <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/g/2PG\">AI Tools</a> and create your own, just download the action group from the directory and make sure to read through the docs before using any of the actions or create your own.</p>\n<p>I really hope that the AI Tools action group is helpful for you and enables users to create helpful AI-powered actions for themselves without the need to script on their own. I would be interested to hear what you enjoy, what you dislike, and most importantly what use cases you created for yourself. I would be happy to hear from you on <a href=\"https://social.lol/@flohgro/111761185368113113\">Mastodon</a>.</p>\n<p>Under the hood the action runs another action from the action group which is not visible in the list that contains the full script ‚Äì if you‚Äôre interested you can have a look at the action by navigating into the ‚Äúmanage action groups panel‚Äù and look for the ‚ÄúAIToolBuilderScript‚Äù action. The code of the script is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/drafts-actions/blob/main/aiToolBuilder.js\">GitHub</a>, too.</p>\n",

Of course there are regular costs (e.g. this website or the great social.lol instance on Mastodon by <a href=\"https://omg.lol\">omg.lol</a>) but the most expensive thing of course is my own time. I love creating tools and helping people improve and simplify their workflows so I never paywalled these things. On the other hand it‚Äôs really great to get some appreciation and a little compensation of the costs.</p>\n<p>In short: I added (or changed) membership tiers on my <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/flohgro\">ko-fi</a> and <a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/flohgro\">buymeacoffee</a> to 1$ a month. I also changed the minimum amount to 1$ to join the people Jarrod listed on <a href=\"https://oneamonth.club\">oneamonth.club</a>.</p>\n<p>Nothing will change about the stuff I create and share, but if you want to support me on a regular basis, you can do so at the lowest possible cost. I really appreciate every single support I receive, replies / boosts on Mastodon, kind words via email and of course everyone who wants to support <em>One a Month</em>.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n",

However, I wanted to make the most of my highlights by importing them into <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a> for review and processing. A while back, I created the <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2Mt\">import latest Readwise highlights</a> action, which pulls all the new highlights into Drafts. The only downside was having to manually run this action, which was quite inconvenient and in the end of course didn‚Äôt work out..</p>\n<p>Luckily there is a solution to automatically run this action once every day using Shortcuts.<br>\nMy first attempt to set it up as a scheduled automation didn‚Äôt work since running the action requires Drafts to be opened. This isn‚Äôt always possible, especially when the device is locked.<br>\nHowever, I found an effective workaround that involved setting up a personal automation to log the last time Drafts was opened in a file. This enables Shortcuts to determine whether Drafts had been opened that day and trigger the import action accordingly.<br>\nTesting it for the first time ‚Äì I quickly noticed that the original action for importing highlights always loaded a Draft into the editor, potentially disrupting your workflow. To address this issue, I created a modified version of the action specifically for automated execution.

      "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a> Version 46 was released today. In this post, I will highlight new features and my personal highlights of the release.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://flohgro.com/new-site/assets/Thursday-12-Dec-2024-201012-Y0bAJGRP2SFo.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>A few weeks ago I <a href=\"https://social.lol/@flohgro/113534112362382431\">dipped my toes</a> into <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/development/syntax-format\">Syntax development</a> for Drafts. I have no need to make big changes but I wanted to define some custom link definitions to e.g. run an action with <code>[[r:process INBOX]]</code>or open a tag filter with <code>[[t:project::active]]</code> ‚Äì it is also published to the <a href=\"https://directory.getdrafts.com/s/2Vj\">directory</a> (and I maintain it in the respective <a href=\"https://github.com/FlohGro-dev/drafts-syntaxes\">GitHub repository</a>). When I added those link definitions I quickly noticed that the URL scheme that the <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/urlschemes#search\">/search</a> URL scheme did default to the inbox folder in Drafts. What I wanted was to directly jump to the <em>all</em> folder to see every draft tagged with the given tag. After requesting the additional parameter it was added with this release and it works great. Now you can pass a folder parameter to force switching the folder tab in the draft list. E.g. <code>drafts://search?tag=project&amp;folder=all</code> will filter the drafts list for all drafts tagged with <em>project</em>. I use this e.g. in my Weekly Review checklist together with the mentioned syntax it is easily possible to quickly filter for all drafts that are tagged with <code>project::active</code>. Another way I use this is to link to special searches from routine tasks in Todoist that open a specific predefined search.</p>\n<p>While I don‚Äôt have a big personal use for it right now a new feature in Drafts 46 is Text-to-Speech. The described use case in the <a href=\"https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-46-released-text-to-speech-background-actions/15670/8?u=flohgro\">forum</a> e.g. as snippet library for often used phrases for verbally challenged users is an exceptionally great example. I appreciate that features like this are added to Drafts and extend its capabilities in ways I never thought about. If you want to find out more about this have a look at the <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/text-to-speech\">guide</a> which also includes some example actions that are ready to use to e.g. read the currently selected text.</p>\n<p>My favorite new feature however is the new ‚ÄúRun Action in Background‚Äù shortcuts action.<br>\nIn fact, these are two new actions to either run a Drafts action on a given draft or on a provided text (which can be empty).<br>\nThis allows triggering Drafts‚Äô actions from shortcuts without making Drafts the active app.<br>\nA few months ago I found a (tacky) solution to <a href=\"https://flohgro.com/automation/automating-readwise-highlights-import-into-drafts/\">automate importing my Readwise highlights into Drafts</a>. With this release, you can now create a scheduled automation that runs Drafts actions at a specific time of the day. Another example could be a tickler file action as discussed in <a href=\"https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/is-it-possible-to-make-a-tickler-file-action/15578/5?u=flohgro\">this</a> forum thread. The background execution has some restrictions. Actions that require user interactions (e.g. responding to a prompt) will not work ‚Äì as stated in the <a href=\"https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-46-released-text-to-speech-background-actions/15670#p-44685-background-actions-with-caveats-4?u=flohgro\">release notes</a> Drafts will try to not display actions when you select the action in the Shortcuts editor but since evaluating this e.g. for scripted actions is not an easy task this is not bulletproof.<br>\nIf you have a use case I recommend just trying to run the Action from a Shortcut without setting up the automation first. Then double-check if you see the expected result in Drafts and set up the automation afterward. The potential for this feature is big! If you‚Äôre using Daily Notes you can let Drafts create that note daily (or weekly/monthly) in the background and once you open the app they will already be there. I will try to automate posting quotes to Mastodon with this feature.<br>\nOf course, this is not only relevant for automation, this can also be used to run Drafts actions in other shortcuts.</p>\n<p>Another solid release of Drafts ‚Äì if you want to dive into the discussions of the new release head over to the announcement <a href=\"https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-46-released-text-to-speech-background-actions/15670?u=flohgro\">in the forum</a>. I‚Äôm interested in your use cases for the new <em>Run Action in Background</em> shortcuts action step ‚Äì whether as automation or integrated into any other shortcut. Share them in the forum or send them over to me on <a href=\"https://social.lol/@flohgro\">Mastodon</a> or <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/flohgro.bsky.social\">Bluesky</a>.</p>\n",
